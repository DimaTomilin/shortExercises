## Calc Project
It is my symply calc project. I made it with using Webpack and modules. It was the most important thing. And now some derectives.

1. After click on one of operators the previous value will removed it is work like Iphone calculatore.
2. My calc support clicking on operator if it is long experssion, the result will change.
3. Percent action takes reminder of dividing.
4. Sqrt button return sqrt of the number that in inputArea at the moment
5. Delete button makes refresh to calc and deletes all information.
6. I use a simple math module `math.js`, implementing the following methods:
    * `add(n1, n2)`
    * `sub(n1, n2)`
    * `multiply(n1, n2)`
    * `divide(n1, n2)`
    * `percent(n1, n2)`
    * `equals(n1, n2, callback)`
7. Also I have some things that I must to improve: I have buttons "(" and ")" that doesn`t work, so i want to improve my calc and make it more useable. This change will take possibility to write long expression in the inputArea i after click on equalsButton inside cacl logic will build right order of operators and will compute it. It will be available soon!
